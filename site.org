I have a [[/Morgan-Bauer-OpenSourceEngineer-resume.pdf][Resume]] and [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganbauer/][linkedin account @morganbauer]].

I enjoy working in open source software communities. My most recent experience is heavily based in *[[https://golang.org/][golang]]*, but I would like to professionally work with [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][rust]].

I have been fortunate enough to be accepted to speak at many public conferences all over the world, as well as internally within IBM. These presentations have not only been short conference talks, but also multi-hour workshops to deep dive into the open source software I have worked directly on, as well as basic education on developer tooling, such as git & docker.

**** Hyperledger Global Forum 2020


Hyperledger Fabric 101 - Swetha Repakula & Morgan Bauer, IBM

https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/hyperledger-global-forum-2020/program/agenda/

https://sched.co/Xoew


Join Swetha and Morgan as they provide an introduction to the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Platform.
They will step through a high level overview of Fabric architecture and internals.
The introduction will also include an understanding of the project from an open source perspective so attendees are informed of how they can contribute their input, feedback and possibly code to the project.
With that foundation, they will then guide attendees through an hands on experience with the Fabric platform.
The workshop will involve participants standing up their own Fabric network, deploying smart contracts, and interacting with their contracts using decentralized applications.
They will leave the tutorial with a better understanding of the properties of permissioned blockchains, and decentralized application development.

Fabric is a Hyperledger project under the Linux Foundation, and forms the core of the IBM Blockchain Platform, a cloud service that provides an environment to run smart contracts.
Come learn the basics about how blockchains work, and how they are specifically applied in Fabric.

As a workshop, attendees should bring their computer to participate. This workshop requires some command line experience, and is focused on a Unix-like environment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knKSSKMkdHY

 SIG Service-Catalog Deep Dive – Doug Davis, Michael Kibbe, Google, & Morgan Bauer, IBM (Intermediate Skill Level) In the "SIG Service-Catalog Intro" session we provided an overview of the Open Service Broker API and the Kubernetes implementation being developed by the Service Catalog SIG. With that background, this session will go into some of the challenges we faced in making it a reality. Whether it was because we were trying to use bleeding edge features of K8s, or trying to align very radically different processing models between K8s and other OSB API Platforms, our SIG has had an interesting time trying to navigate these waters. Come learn about these these challenges and how we've chosen to solve them.

***** Open Service Brokers for the CF Container Runtime - Jonathan Berkhahn & Morgan Bauer, IBM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2XIhdiVm4


Open Service Brokers for the CF Container Runtime - Jonathan Berkhahn & Morgan Bauer, IBM

The Open Service Broker API is an open standard based on the Cloud
Foundry service broker model. The Cloud Foundry Container Runtime is
backed by Kubernetes, a container orchestrator. The Kubernetes Service
Catalog project is an implementation of the platform side of the
OSBAPI running as part of Kubernetes. Come learn how to utilize the
same brokers and services you use for applications running on CF for
containers hosted by the new container runtime. We'll briefly cover
the service broker architecture before demoing the set-up and
operation of the Service Catalog on top of the CF Container Runtime
and going over best practices for writing brokers to ensure that they
are multi-platform compatible.

should each TIL be it's own entry on the blog or one large page?

** <2021-01-01 Fri> ext4 defragmenting & pacman package caching

*** defrag
e4defrag -c
to check the amount of fragmentation
-v for verbose details of each file.

When run without -c it will perform the defragmentation.


*** pacman cache
not sure if pacman doesn't clean up, or what, but paccache -r from pacman-contrib.

*** a thing I knew

ext4 fs reserves 5% of free space for root, which on a large disk is hundreds of gigabytes.
tune with `tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sda1` etc. it does take fractional decimal points.

If you're trying to run #kubernetes e2e-node tests with ~make test-e2e-node~ and you're trying to run them locally, you may need to add ~TEST_ARG='--kubelet-flags=--fail-swap-on=false'~ because your normal everyday dev machine probably has swap enabled.

 and finding

 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4214949/emacs-removing-all-lines-that-dont-match

 and the most useful part, reproduced below https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4214949/emacs-removing-all-lines-that-dont-match#comment4574108_4215809

 The documentation for delete-non-matching-lines explains this is an alias for keep-lines and delete-matching-lines is an alias for flush-lines

** TODO 2020-05-12
Put contact information, keywords, and page numbers on slides.

I've learned this previously, but I'm writing it down, because it happened to me again relatively recently.

It is almost certain that people will see a single slide out of context and now know how to get more information from you.

keywords help with context, date helps with knowing the version of a presentation, contact info helps with reaching out, page numbers helps if there are repeats, and also again with versioning.

** TODO Org to Netlify in One Step :emacs:

Since Netlify provides emacs in their [[https://github.com/netlify/build-image][build-image]], we can call emacs
during our build step. We can use emacs to render to markdown with
[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]. After we have the markdown, we can render that with
[[https://gohugo.io/][hugo]]. This can all be done server-side, so the rendered markdown does
not have to be committed to the repo.

** TODO Open source contributions

It's a cycle. How do you know what to read? Other people said
stuff. How did other people know to read your stuff? You said stuff!
It sounds kind of slimey to be shilling your own stuff, but it's not,
because everyone is busy with their own stuff. They are also generally
good people and WANT to look at your stuff. They need a reminder at
times.

I am here to work on Docker.


** TODO ffmpeg multiple video filters

ffmpeg has a many options and flags. I look them up and can never remember.

When dealing with video filters, do not use multiple instances of the
flag, but separate filters by commas.
 
May need to quote the entire filter string?

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v fps=fps=30, scale=1920:-2 output.mp4

and NOT
`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v fps=fps=30 -filter:v scale=1920:-2 output.mp4`

** Set default flags in magit commit screen
:properties:
:export_file_name: magit-default-flags
:end:

see my stackoverflow answer, reproduced below
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3893/how-can-i-make-verbose-flag-be-enabled-by-default-in-magit-commit-screen

In the versions of magit that use transient (after February 2019 or so), set the flag, and then save while still in the transient buffer.

So for commit, the key sequence would be something like

C-x g # start magit
s # to stage changes
c # start commiting
-v # enable verbose
C-x C-s # Save the setting persistently across sessions
c # do the actual commit

After that, next time commit is invoked, verbose will still be set. (You do not have to complete the commit, and can exit after saving with C-x C-s.)

The actual default is saved in a transient/ directory in .emacs.d/.

See the transient manual https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Saving-Values
