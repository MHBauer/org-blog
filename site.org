? insert a timestamp for meeting start?

C-c C-x 0     (org-timer-start)

notice the timer in the mode line, as well.

now, start a description list, and insert the timer as the *term*  C-c C-x .     (org-timer)

When run without -c it will perform the defragmentation.


*** pacman cache
not sure if pacman doesn't clean up, or what, but paccache -r from pacman-contrib.

*** a thing I knew

ext4 fs reserves 5% of free space for root, which on a large disk is hundreds of gigabytes.
tune with `tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sda1` etc. it does take fractional decimal points.

artillery line, traded away my metal (bit of tin with a ribbon),
cherry orchard, house, plane attack, deadth, trucks, bridge oeer
river, sniper, knockout blacknesss, flares through the night in town,
burning building, charse, flee, baby underground basement, morning
bells of church, sneaking, flee, jump into river, river survival, dead
men clogging up the rver, sining in a dell, moving up new trench
lines, run out across new no mans land, deliver orders, call off the
attack, move back into triage area, find brother, take a break, back
to tree in meadow, look at pictures of wife and kids.

see my stackoverflow answer, reproduced below
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3893/how-can-i-make-verbose-flag-be-enabled-by-default-in-magit-commit-screen

In the versions of magit that use transient (after February 2019 or so), set the flag, and then save while still in the transient buffer.

So for commit, the key sequence would be something like

C-x g # start magit
s # to stage changes
c # start commiting
-v # enable verbose
C-x C-s # Save the setting persistently across sessions
c # do the actual commit

After that, next time commit is invoked, verbose will still be set. (You do not have to complete the commit, and can exit after saving with C-x C-s.)

The actual default is saved in a transient/ directory in .emacs.d/.

See the transient manual https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Saving-Values

Advanced strength 0800

instead of doing the pyramid 10 reps down to 1. we've switched to "five by five"
so, five sets of five reps. I started with the most I had previously been using
in a pyramid, the 25kg kettlebell in the goblin hold. Moving up, I found the
single 75lb pretty easy to squat 5 times. The goal for the month was to be
building up endurance, which was not relevant to me, as I was just starting out
in my first month. Two dumbbells is pretty unwieldy to raise to shoulder level
and hold. I will have to switch to using the smith machine, or get help from
people to hand me one to each shoulder. I'm not sure the correspondence between
these types of squats and the leg press machine, but I do recall being able to
press the entire stack of weights on that machine.

started with a kettlebell, moved to single dumbbell, then double
dumbbell, then to the cable machine. Probably going to max out on the
cable machine next time. At which point it's back to double dumbbell,
which is awkward, or the smith machine, also awkward.  Ends at 72.5
