Morgan bridges the gap between theory and practice for containers and Kubernetes,
by bringing not only theoretical knowledge upstream open source experience on the projects,
but also practical application of that knowledge from running multiple Kubernetes clusters with over 1000 nodes.

Morgan is also an Open Source Software (OSS) Engineer,
previously working for IBM on Kubernetes,
Docker and the surrounding container technologies.
He has extensive experience in the creation of open source software,
containerized software development and complex system architecture.
Morgan also enjoys working with cross-functional teams,
and presenting at conferences and meetups

Hyperledger Fabric 101 - Swetha Repakula & Morgan Bauer, IBM

https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/hyperledger-global-forum-2020/program/agenda/

https://sched.co/Xoew

*** Workshop Prompt
Join Swetha and Morgan as they provide an introduction to the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Platform.
They will step through a high level overview of Fabric architecture and internals.
The introduction will also include an understanding of the project from an open source perspective so attendees are informed of how they can contribute their input, feedback and possibly code to the project.
With that foundation, they will then guide attendees through an hands on experience with the Fabric platform.
The workshop will involve participants standing up their own Fabric network, deploying smart contracts, and interacting with their contracts using decentralized applications.
They will leave the tutorial with a better understanding of the properties of permissioned blockchains, and decentralized application development.

Fabric is a Hyperledger project under the Linux Foundation, and forms the core of the IBM Blockchain Platform, a cloud service that provides an environment to run smart contracts.
Come learn the basics about how blockchains work, and how they are specifically applied in Fabric.

As a workshop, attendees should bring their computer to participate. This workshop requires some command line experience, and is focused on a Unix-like environment.

About this event
What is a Bootcamp/Workshop?

A bootcamp/workshop is where we help get community members up to speed on how to contribute. Most of the participants are fairly new and we understand that contributing to your first project can be daunting. This process takes the fear out of the process. For existing contributors and maintainer, this is the ideal place to recruit more help for your project or group.

Who should attend and why?

Anyone that wants to contribute. This includes: developers, designers, writers, organizers, artists, and of course project managers. Anyone that needs contributions. There isn't a better place to recruit and get to know new participants. Don't limit yourself to thinking the only contributions you need at first are code! Most contributors start out by fixing documentation and creating or flushing our bug reports. Then they often move to fixing small bugs before making larger contributions. Also an OSS community doesn't thrive if it isn't diverse. You need writers, designers, and project managers etc. Include them in your plans.

What to bring?

Laptop, power cord and comfortable clothing. This hands-on workshop requires several gigabytes of downloads to participate. Please go to the following link and complete the `Prerequisites` Section which asks you to install Docker and Node, as well as download a git code repository and run a script to pull the required docker images.

Smart contracts are one of the must-have features that most blockchain technologies provide today.
Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain platform where people write smart contracts in general purpose programming languages like Go or Javascript.
In comparison, Ethereum invented Contract-Oriented Languages such as Solidity,
and created the web3 JS library to interact with smart contracts.
Progress has been made in the Hyperledger community to incorporate a similar developer experience into Fabric.

This workshop will cover how to run the EVM in Fabric, deploy sample smart contracts and how to use the web3.js library to interact with them via the Fab3 proxy.
In the process attendees will also learn the basics of using Hyperledger Fabric.
Developers familiar with Ethereum can easily migrate their Decentralized Apps (DApps) and are welcome to bring them to use during the workshop.
This version of the workshop will be focused on the Fabric platform in general versus the EVM feature.

When one thinks of blockchain, the technologies that come to mind are Bitcoin, and Ethereum.
Much of the knowledge has been focused on public networks,
and less is known about the permissioned blockchain platforms out there like Hyperledger Fabric.
Fabric is an open source blockchain platform that has been designed for corporate use cases.
Morgan and Swetha will go through the architecture of Hyperledger Fabric detailing the transaction work flow,
consensus mechanism and smart contract capabilities.
Attendees will leave with knowledge about the Hyperledger Consortium as well as details into the Fabric platform.

I assisted with this workshop as it related to docker and containers. OpenWhisk not only attaches routes to code snippets, but also can attach and run containers in response. During the various social vents, I got to meet Myrle Krantz, who impressed upon me the value of every contributor, in all forms. It is not only coding that is key, it is the education and documentation as well. No contribution, no matter how small is undeserving of praise and recognition.

This was the 20th Anniverary of the Apache Foundation.

James Gosling was there, so that was cool too.

*** Workshop Prompt
This workshop will teach you how to develop serverless applications, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions, using the Apache OpenWhisk open-source serverless platform.

Starting with getting the development environment set up, it’ll move onto creating, deploying and invoking serverless functions for multiple runtimes. Once you are comfortable creating serverless functions, the next step is to connect functions to events, like message queues, allowing microservices to fire automatically. Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to expose serverless functions as public API endpoints, allowing to build serverless web applications.

Welcome to the future of cloud development, you’ll never want to manage another server again!

*** Prompt
The winners of the 2018 CF Summit Boston Hackathon are back discussing the details of their winning hackathon project - the BlockHead broker. BlockHead is a dedicated service broker developed based on the Open Service Broker (OSB) API that allows for the creation and deployment of smart contracts through creation and binding of services in Cloud Foundry. Developing smart contracts is difficult. The numerous steps of having to spin up a dedicated node, creating an account, compiling the smart contract, deploying the contract, and then binding to the contract through the generated interface make it hard for the average developer to easily build and test their distributed blockchain apps (dApps). We will demonstrate how the use of the BlockHead broker significantly facilitates the process of deploying and binding to smart contracts and helps developers focus on developing their web applications. Through integration with PaaS platforms such as Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, developers can benefit from all the great features of a PaaS platform, including scalability promises , resiliency, etc.

*** CFP Submission
Day by day, the number of open source projects continues to increase. Each project has unique communities and practice different developmentmethodologies. This talk will focus on the Docker, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry cultures and outline their main differences and commonalities. The projects have different review processes from the pair programming model to the LGTM process, an interesting artifact of github. Becoming a committer on CF relies on the Dojo, while Docker establishes a meritocracy of peers and Kubernetes behaves similarly with individual sponsors.

Morgan will share his journey of becoming a maintainer on the core Docker Engine and a founding member of the Kubernetes Service Catalog. Swetha will tell her story of becoming a contributor on the Diego team and what she has learnt from Cloud Foundry. By sharing their experiences, they hope to encourage others to participate.

**** Mini Description:
Learn about cloud native open source projects, namely Kubernetes, Docker, and Cloud Foundry, and their development methodologies, cultures, communities.

**** What Audience Will Gain:
The audience will leave the talk with a better understanding of different cloud native communities and their respective cultures. Specifically how open source projects can be governed, developed and collaborated on. The attendees will become better informed and have the ability to be more involved with open source software development.

**** Benefits to the Ecosystem:
We hope by informing engineering managers and developers about how open source technologies are governed, and developed they will be better prepared to choose open source projects and effectively contribute to them. The goal is to increase participation in open source development.

 SIG Service-Catalog Deep Dive – Doug Davis, Michael Kibbe, Google, & Morgan Bauer, IBM (Intermediate Skill Level) In the "SIG Service-Catalog Intro" session we provided an overview of the Open Service Broker API and the Kubernetes implementation being developed by the Service Catalog SIG. With that background, this session will go into some of the challenges we faced in making it a reality. Whether it was because we were trying to use bleeding edge features of K8s, or trying to align very radically different processing models between K8s and other OSB API Platforms, our SIG has had an interesting time trying to navigate these waters. Come learn about these these challenges and how we've chosen to solve them.

The Open Service Broker API is an open standard based on the Cloud
Foundry service broker model. The Cloud Foundry Container Runtime is
backed by Kubernetes, a container orchestrator. The Kubernetes Service
Catalog project is an implementation of the platform side of the
OSBAPI running as part of Kubernetes. Come learn how to utilize the
same brokers and services you use for applications running on CF for
containers hosted by the new container runtime. We'll briefly cover
the service broker architecture before demoing the set-up and
operation of the Service Catalog on top of the CF Container Runtime
and going over best practices for writing brokers to ensure that they
are multi-platform compatible.

**** prompt
Istio provides a proxy to load balance, control traffic behavior, and distribute access controls between services. The Kubernetes Service Catalog, an Open Service Broker implementation, provisions services that are consumed by applications within a cluster. This presentation will demonstrate how Istio can be utilized to proxy communication between a Kubernetes-hosted application and a Service Catalog provisioned database.

The demonstration will start with two applications bound to the same service broker provided service. We will then leverage Istio to direct traffic between the applications from the web and show the metrics that it is collecting. This will demonstrate how Istio can provide value without any modifications to an application.

** DONE Nikon exif field for memory card
CLOSED: [2018-01-04 Thu]
:properties:
:export_file_name: nikon-exif-field-for-slot
:end:

I learned this from owning a Nikon D500 and trying to figure out why the checksums of files on the SD Card and XQD card don't match.

On a D500, which has two card slots, an XQD and an SD, this data is recorded in the file under the exif field 'Memory Card Number'.

=0= is the value for the XQD Card slot.
=1= is the value for the SD Card slot.

ext4 fs reserves 5% of free space for root, which on a large disk is hundreds of gigabytes.
tune with `tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sda1` etc. it does take fractional decimal points.

:end:

see my stackoverflow answer, reproduced below
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3893/how-can-i-make-verbose-flag-be-enabled-by-default-in-magit-commit-screen

In the versions of magit that use transient (after February 2019 or so), set the flag, and then save while still in the transient buffer.

So for commit, the key sequence would be something like

C-x g # start magit
s # to stage changes
c # start commiting
-v # enable verbose
C-x C-s # Save the setting persistently across sessions
c # do the actual commit

After that, next time commit is invoked, verbose will still be set. (You do not have to complete the commit, and can exit after saving with C-x C-s.)

The actual default is saved in a transient/ directory in .emacs.d/.

* DONE Net Present Value Calculation :finance:
CLOSED: [2021-06-15 Tue 22:12]
:properties:
:export_file_name: npv-calculations
:end:

I keep relearning this, so I want to make it clear to myself.

The general concept is to know whether it is a good idea to pay a lump sum now, or to pay installments over time. When there is a discount for paying now, what is the equivalent interest rate to paying over time. There are times where paying the lump sum, being a guaranteed return, is significant enough that it makes sense to pay now if possible rather than paying later.

Time value of money. Money in the future is not worth as much as money now. This is primarily due to inflation. Thus it's good to know what the effective interest rate is on any payment, so you can compare with interest rates you think you can get elsewhere.

Life example would be car insurance, which I have encountered billed in 6 month increments, but with an installment fee, or some other structure of costs where the two six-month payments do not equal to the 12 month payment. When it is the same cost at both times, that indicates that there is some rate of return.

Another case would be the case of some 'lifetime' subscription. This is also a net present value, in the form of a perpetuity.

If a magazine subscription is 29.95 a year, and you can get 2 years for 55.95, and three years for 79.95, and a lifetime for 295.00.

Let's start with the lifetime perpetuity, as that is actually the simplest calctulation. =PV = PMT / i= In our case, we assume the payment PMT is the yearly cost, 29.95, and the Present Value PV is 295. Rearranging =i = PV/PMT= leading us to an interest rate of =29.95/295 = 0.101525423729 = 10.15%=. This means that buying now for 295 is worth the equivalent of payments of 29.95, forever.

This is easily checked:
  1. 295 * 10.15% = 29.95, we pay 29.95 for a year, and have 295 left to grow interest on.
  2. the calculation does not differ.

An alternative form considers the inflation in terms of a growing sum, due to inflation. =PV = PMT / (i - g)=, rearranging similarly, =(i - g) = PMT/PV=. We can see that inflation comes directly out of the normal interest rate, meaning =i= must be that much higher to offset.

Back to auto insurance, what's the rate on a 1200$ payment executed in two payments of 700$ on the half year? This is equivalent to an "annuity due" calulation. To calculate, we figure out how much the annuity due is worth in the future, and discount it back to the present. The formulation is much uglier and more difficult to calculate i for, and in spreadsheets is done with =IRR=, although you can 'guess and check' with =PV=.

For this case, we do =pv(guess%, 2,-700,0,1)= and adjust the guess percentage until it equals 1200.

With =IRR= we need to calculate the difference between the lump sum and the partial payment for our first period, and then use the partial payments after.  =irr({500,-700},1)= which spits out 40%, and we can plug back into the PV function as our 'guess' to get the result of 1200. That's a 40% interest charge for paying partially! Better to get that money together and pay it now!

A more reasonable calculation would have perhaps a 2.5% payment fee per installment. This would be solving =pv(guess%, 2,-615,0,1)= for the percentage to be equal to 1200. Or =irr({585,-615})= which comes out to 5%. A 2.5% fee costs you 5% in opportunity interest. You pay 1230 for 1200 of coverage. The simple interest rate of 2.5% becomes 5% as you need a higher interest rate on your remaining money in the time period to make up for what you don't have to make interest on.

 1. 1200 - 615 = 585 left
 2. I need 615 in the future from my 585 now, so I need =x * 585 = 615=, =x = 5.128%=. over my period. This is the simple rate done semi-annually, so an anual rate would be very slightly higher.
